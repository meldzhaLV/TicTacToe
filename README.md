## Tic Tac Toe

**This is a console based TicTacToe Game**

## About the project

  1. This is a project from hyperskill.org. It is a project-based learning website for Java learners.
  

## Issues

  1. There could be a lot of improvements in the code. It could be possible to divide the code into classes or more methods.
  2. A lot of the code is badly structured but the logic works. There could be a seperate class for running the game.
